              "' (CNN)At approximately 11am on Saturday, January 29th, in the Philadelphia area of the United States, a 27-year-old man is intending to ease his seven-foot frame into a chair -- or perhaps remain standing -- and turn on the device of his choosing, to spend 90 minutes consumed by the events unfolding on a soccer field in his birthplace of Yaoundé, Cameroon.Warning: People in the vicinity may hear cheering -- loud, loud cheering. The fact that said sounds could be emanating from one of the best basketball players on the planet merely adds to the intrigue.When he\\'s not playing Most Valuable Player-caliber ball for the Philadelphia 76ers -- and his definition of \"a bad night\" was a near triple-double of 26 points, nine rebounds, and seven assists in a 105-87 rout of the Los Angeles Lakers on Thursday -- five-time NBA All-Star Joel Embiid is rooting for his nation of Cameroon at the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), which his homeland happens to be hosting. Saturday\\'s quarterfinal pits the Indomitable Lions against The Gambia in a match Embiid\\'s team is expected to win. Victory would mean Cameroon is two games away from lifting a sixth AFCON title, with the most recent coming in 2017, the center\\'s rookie year for the 76ers.Embiid was named Eastern Conference Rookie of the Month just three days before Cameroon defeated Egypt 2-1 in the 2017 final; a match-up which, if all things fall into place, could happen again on Sunday, February 6th.Read More\"The excitement level has always been huge,\" Embiid tells CNN Sport\\'s Amanda Davies about his love of the Cameroon national team dating back to childhood. \"The crazy thing is that when Cameroon would always play, anytime they would score, everybody would just scream. You could hear the whole country just scream.\"Joel Embiid is playing at an MVP level this season.The love of the LionsWhile his remarkable journey brought Embiid to America at the age of 16 -- first via high school and college in Florida and Kansas, and subsequently selected 3rd overall in the 2014 NBA Draft by Philadelphia -- he was born a few years after Cameroon\\'s fairytale run to the quarterfinals of the 1990 World Cup in Italy.The first African nation to advance to the last eight, a mere seven minutes away from reaching the final four, Cameroon eventually succumbed to England in extra-time. Along the way, the Indomitable Lions wowed the world, starting with the upset of reigning champion Argentina in the opening match. \"Obviously, Roger Milla kind of put us on the map,\" recalls Embiid about the then 38-year-old striker Milla scoring four times at Italia \\'90, gaining further fame for his trademark goal celebration of dancing by the corner flag.\"Going back through history and watching the games, and learning through the history before I was born, and obviously the celebration was a huge part of that history ... we have a lot of history coming from Cameroon, and any time I get the chance to kind of be part of it, I always enjoy.\"READ: Iranian women allowed to watch landmark moment as Iran qualifies for World CupEmbiid has watched all of Cameroon\\'s matches at AFCON.Embiid believes that the class of 2022 can reign supreme at Africa\\'s showpiece tournament. \"We\\'re playing at home so any time you\\'ve got the support from your home fans that usually adds a lot to your motivation to go on and win every single game,\" he observes.\"Playing at home is a huge advantage for us, and I think we\\'ve got a chance to win it all ... I\\'m excited to keep watching and keep supporting.\"Cameroon\\'s success at AFCON notwithstanding, the fortunes of a football team pale in comparison to the deaths which occurred at the Olembe Stadium in Yaoundé last Monday due to a stadium crush. At least eight people were killed and 38 injured during the Round of 16 game between Cameroon and Comoros.A somber Embiid says: \"I\\'m a man of God, so I pray for those families to find peace and also for their loved ones to find peace and be at peace. It is tragic that it happened and I\\'m extremely sorry for it.\" Given the horrific events, what would it mean to Embiid and Cameroon if the team does go on to lift the trophy?\"As a country, we\\'ve been through a lot,\" he reveals. \"We haven\\'t had any competition [held] over there for a long time, so to be able to finally get it and to be able to win, I think is going to be huge for us.\"Embiid tells CNN he\\'s set his sights on winning the MVP award this season.AFCON getting more creditIn the build up to AFCON 2022, there was discussion in some quarters that stars such as Liverpool\\'s Mohamed Salah (Egypt) and Sadio Mané (Senegal), Manchester City\\'s Riyad Mahrez (Algeria), Paris Saint-Germain\\'s Achraf Hakimi (Morocco) and Kalidou Koulibaly (Senegal) temporarily leaving their club sides behind was such a bitter pill for their club sides and supporters to swallow, it overshadowed the prestige which comes from representing one\\'s country, to say nothing of elevating the tournament to the levels attained across other continents. Embiid follows European football closely, so does he concur that AFCON fails to get the credit it deserves on the global stage?Substitute keeper Abo Gabal the shootout hero as Egypt advance\"It\\'s messed up,\" Embiid quickly concludes. \"When it always comes to Africa, I feel like there\\'s always kind of double standards. I never hear any complaints when it comes to the European Cup or any other cups.\"[AFCON]\\'s a little different because obviously it\\'s going on during the season over there, and some of the best players, when you talk about someone like Mo Salah or Sadio [Mané] they\\'re supposed to be playing for their clubs. But I also appreciate them wanting to just go back and represent their country, which is good.\"I think we\\'re still earning our respect ... when you look at the success that Africa has in general, we have a lot of talent. Not just in football but in basketball or other sports too. Over time, we\\'re going to overcome that but it\\'s getting there slowly.\"As for the big man himself, when asked what would mean more to him -- Cameroon triumphing at AFCON or Embiid winning MVP -- he smiles. \"That\\'s tough! I want both -- both would be great!\"It would have been a better question if you were to ask me between Cameroon winning or me winning a championship!\" Asked then which he would prefer, Embiid said, \"Both would be great, like I said, I\\'m a competitor -- I want to win.\"Embiid will be tuning in to watch Cameroon\\'s quarterfinal against The Gambia.After detailing the hard work Cameroon made of their previous opponents Comoros, as the continental minnows played much of the match with 10 men and the entire game with an outfield player in goal, Embiid gives a message to the team of his heart ahead of the challenges which await.\"Go out there and keep doing whatever they\\'ve been doing. At the end, they\\'ve been doing great. They have our full support to continue to do so and I really hope that they\\'re able to keep that cup in our home territory, so I\\'m gonna keep supporting them. Like I said, I\\'m going to be watching the rest of the games.\"Will we see another iconic celebration like Embiid\\'s Twitter video of Max Verstappen\\'s maiden Formula One title if the Indomitable Lions pull off their sixth AFCON crown? \"I hope the excitement of when we get to the final is the same thing [as the F1 finale]. We might get one!\"'"

              "'Washington (CNN)When President Joe Biden passingly said in a voting rights speech last week that he had been \"arrested\" in the context of the civil rights movement -- even suggesting this had happened more than once -- it was a classic Biden false claim: an anecdote about his past for which there is no evidence, prompted by a decision to ad-lib rather than stick to a prepared text, resulting in easily avoidable questions about his honesty.   Biden\\'s imaginary or embellished stories about his own history were the most memorable falsehoods of his first year in office. They were not, however, the only ones. The President also made multiple false claims about important policy matters, notably including three subjects that occupied much of his time: the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, the economy and the Covid-19 pandemic. And Biden was incorrect on numerous occasions when ad-libbing about a wide assortment of facts and figures -- sometimes in a way that appeared inadvertent, but other times in a way that helped him make a political point.   Unlike his uniquely dishonest predecessor, Biden did not bury fact-checkers in a daily avalanche of serial falseness. Biden never came close to making a dozen false claims in a single speech, let alone five dozen false claims in one address, as Trump once did. In fact, the total number of Biden false claims so far is in the dozens, while Trump delivered well over 1,000 total false claims in his own first year and more than 3,000 the next year. Read MoreSo Biden is no Trump. With that said, dozens of false claims from the President of the United States is not nothing. And considering that Biden added dozens more claims that were misleading or lacking in important context, he provided more than enough material to keep fact-checkers on their toes. Here is a roundup of Biden\\'s first year in inaccuracy. The White House declined to comment for this article; it has previously commented for individual fact checks on some of the false claims we are discussing again below.False claims about his own pastBiden made a series of claims about his own past that were just not true. It was these easy-to-understand, hard-to-defend personal falsehoods -- more than his false claims about complex policy issues or obscure statistics, which supporters could more easily dismiss as good-faith errors -- that provided the best ammunition for opponents looking to portray him as deceptive.And like some of Trump\\'s tall tales about his past, Biden\\'s tended to be peripheral to his message. In other words, he was hurting his reputation for little possible gain.While talking in November to technical college students standing near a truck, Biden claimed, \"I used to drive a tractor-trailer,\" though only for \"part of a summer.\" This was similar to something he had said at a Mack Trucks facility in July, when he claimed, \"I used to drive an 18-wheeler, man,\" adding, \"I got to.\" There is no evidence Biden ever drove a big truck; the White House previously noted to CNN that he once had a job driving a school bus (which is not an 18-wheeler or a tractor-trailer) and that, as a senator in 1973, he spent a night riding in a cargo truck (not driving it).Biden repeatedly told a story about a supposed conversation during his vice presidency with an old friend, an Amtrak train conductor, that could not possibly have happened because the man was dead at the time. He repeatedly boasted that he had traveled \"17,000 miles\" with Chinese President Xi Jinping, though that number is not even close to correct.Biden distracted from his voting rights message with the baseless claim last week, which he had made before, about having been arrested during a civil rights protest; in some of the previous versions of the story, he had merely claimed a police officer had taken him home from a protest. (There is evidence Biden participated in some civil rights activities in his youth but no record of any arrest.) And Biden told two different inaccurate stories while trying to emphasize his connection to the Jewish community. The 7 most important lines from Joe Biden\\'s news conferenceAt a September event in honor of the High Holy Days, Biden told Jewish leaders that he remembered \"spending time at\" and \"going to\" Pittsburgh\\'s Tree of Life synagogue, the site of an antisemitic massacre in 2018; he had spoken by phone to the synagogue\\'s rabbi in 2019 but never went. At a Hanukkah event in December, Biden claimed that late Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir had invited him to meet with her during the Six-Day War of 1967 (he actually met with her weeks before the Yom Kippur War six years later) and, more significantly, that she had wanted him to be \"the liaison between she and the Egyptians about the Suez, and so on and so forth.\" There is zero evidence Meir ever wanted to use a 30-year-old rookie US senator as a \"liaison\" with a major adversary. False claims about AfghanistanBiden was bedeviled over the summer by his chaotic withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan. And he made a variety of false claims as he tried to defend his handling of the situation -- further undermining his authority on an issue on which he was already struggling to persuade the public.In August, the President said, \"What interest do we have in Afghanistan at this point, with al Qaeda gone?\" Al Qaeda had been degraded in Afghanistan, but it wasn\\'t \"gone\" -- as a Pentagon spokesman acknowledged on camera that same day. In an interview that week, Biden defended the US withdrawal in part by claiming that the concept of nation-building in Afghanistan \"never made any sense to me\" -- though, in fact, he had explicitly advocated nation-building in the early years of the war, both in Afghanistan and more broadly.In July, when Biden was under pressure to quickly relocate Afghans who had assisted US troops, he said \"the law doesn\\'t allow\" Afghan translators to come to the US to await the processing of their visa applications. But experts in immigration law immediately said this wasn\\'t true, given the administration\\'s authority to grant \"parole,\" and, indeed, the Biden administration ended up using parole later in the summer to do what Biden had claimed wasn\\'t permitted. In December, Biden said in another interview that \"I\\'ve been against that war in Afghanistan from the very beginning.\" While he eventually grew opposed to the war, he was not against it from the start -- as fact-checkers pointed out when he had made similar remarks during his presidential campaign.  False claims about the economyThe state of the economy was a key rhetorical battleground between Biden and his critics: He argued it was thriving; they argued it was failing. And although both sides often cited valid data points, the President also made some false claims to bolster his case.Biden occasionally overstated progress and understated problems. Asked at a CNN town hall in July about inflation in automobile prices, he claimed that the cost of a car was \"kind of back to what it was before the pandemic\"; the cost had actually increased substantially since late 2019 and early 2020. In an economic speech in November, he greatly exaggerated the extent of the decline in the unemployment rate during his tenure.To try to sell his economic policies, Biden sometimes made inaccurate statements about what experts had said about them. In May alone, he falsely claimed that there was a consensus among economists about how many jobs his American Jobs Plan would create, significantly overstated how many jobs the firm Moody\\'s Analytics in particular predicted the plan would create and falsely claimed that the last five leaders of the Federal Reserve had said the plan would produce economic growth -- wrongly describing both the contents and the authorship of an article that was actually written by five former Internal Revenue Service chiefs. Later in the year, Biden misleadingly framed another Moody\\'s jobs estimate. And he repeatedly omitted the key phrase \"longer-term\" from an assertion by Nobel-winning economists that his $1.9 trillion Build Back Better agenda would \"ease longer-term inflationary pressures\" -- leaving Americans to believe that these economists might have said his agenda would reduce the inflation hurting their bank accounts today.False claims about the Covid-19 pandemicMany of Biden\\'s first-year speeches were devoted to the Covid-19 pandemic. Biden was almost incomparably more accurate on this subject than Trump was, tending to factually convey the severity of the situation rather than match his predecessor\\'s fantastical rhetoric about how bad numbers were not actually bad numbers and how the virus would just disappear. But Biden made a smattering of false claims on this topic, too.At the CNN town hall in July, Biden made the inaccurate categorical promise that \"you\\'re not going to get Covid\" if you\\'re vaccinated. It was clear even before the emergence of the Omicron variant that vaccinated people were still getting infected with the virus, though the vaccines made them much less likely to get seriously ill; vaccinated people on the President\\'s own staff had been infected. Biden also went too far at the town hall when he categorically pledged that \"if you\\'re vaccinated, you\\'re not going to be hospitalized, you\\'re not going to be in the ICU unit and you\\'re not going to die\"; these outcomes happen, too, though they are much less common among vaccinated people. Biden sometimes exaggerated on the subject of his administration\\'s work to get Americans vaccinated -- misleadingly playing down the Trump administration\\'s own vaccine purchases and, in May, overstating how the US vaccination rate compared with those of the rest of the world. And he made various errors in discussing pandemic-related facts and figures.In February, Biden claimed that \"suicides are up\" amid the pandemic; experts said at the time that the claim was premature, and it turned out to be wrong (though suicide rates did increase for some specific demographic groups). In October, the President wrongly told Americans that there were \"over 800,000\" vaccination sites in the country; he had added an extra 0 to the correct figure he usually used, 80,000.False claims in unscripted settingsWhen Biden stuck to prepared speeches vetted by his staff, he tended to be factual (though certainly wasn\\'t perfect). When he ad-libbed or participated in unscripted exchanges with journalists and citizens, he was more likely to sprinkle in inaccuracies -- making false or misleading claims about everything from his handling of the situation at the southern border to Virginia political history to gun laws to the size of a tax break for people who own racehorses.During Biden\\'s first 100 days in the Oval Office, he was repeatedly incorrect or misleading in describing the actions of the Trump administration. And he made one particularly notable misleading claim during that early period. At a heated moment of the national debate over Georgia Republicans\\' new elections law, Biden did a television interview in which he criticized the law in part by misstating what it says.'"

              "'New York (CNN Business)President Joe Biden planned to reshape the Federal Reserve through his nominations for the three vacant seats on the board of governors. But Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia threw a wrench into those plans Monday.The crux of the matter is the nomination of Sarah Bloom Raskin, a former deputy Treasury secretary and a governor of the Federal Reserve Board during the Obama administration, who is facing opposition in a divided Senate.Raskin\\'s stance on environmental issues, including her view on the transition away from fossil fuels, are colliding with soaring gas prices and a renewed debate about oil independence in the face of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\"Her previous public statements have failed to satisfactorily address my concerns about the critical importance of financing an all-of-the-above energy policy to meet our nation\\'s critical energy needs,\" Manchin said in a statement on Monday announcing his opposition to Raskin\\'s nomination. Manchin is not a member of the Senate Banking Committee that will be voting on Raskin\\'s candidacy.The US Chamber of Commerce already voiced concern over her nomination to be the vice chair of supervision -- essentially the Fed\\'s top banking regulator -- in January. And a month ago, Senate Republicans boycotted a vote in protest of Raskin\\'s nomination, halting a slate of pending nominees for the central bank.Read MoreThe renomination of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell for another term is also stalled. Even though Powell is enjoying support on both sides of the aisle, he hasn\\'t been fully confirmed yet, leaving him with the title add-on \"pro tempore\" for now.All this comes at a time when Fed policy has taken center stage amid rampant inflation. Consumer prices haven\\'t risen at this fast a pace since 1982.The central bank is expected to raise interest rates by a quarter-percentage point this week in an effort to curb demand and bring prices under control.Meanwhile, the White House continued to stand behind Raskin\\'s nomination. Biden has pledged to make the Fed more diverse in terms of both its gender and racial make up. The president also nominated Philip Jefferson and Lisa Cook to join the central bank. Cook would be the first Black woman to serve at the Fed in its history.\"Sarah Bloom Raskin is one of the most qualified people to have ever been nominated for the Federal Reserve Board of Governors -- she previously served on the Board and she served as second-in-command at Treasury, both positions where she earned bipartisan Senate confirmation,\" a White House official said.The administration was working to line up bipartisan support for her confirmation, the official added, calling the adversity surrounding her nomination an \"unprecedented, baseless campaign led by oil and gas companies.\"CNN\\'s Manu Raju and Phil Mattingly contributed to this report.'"
